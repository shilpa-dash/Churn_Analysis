# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Dashboard

## 🛑 Business Problem

Telecom companies lose a significant number of customers every month due to churn.
Without proper analytics, it becomes difficult for management to:

-- Identify which customer segments are most likely to churn

-- Understand patterns across contract types, tenure, age group, and services

-- Take proactive actions to retain high-value customers

-- Reduce revenue loss with data-driven decisions

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Telecom Churn Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI, with data cleaned and transformed using SQL Server.

The dashboard highlights churn patterns, customer behaviour, and retention opportunities to help management make informed decisions.

**Key highlights:**

-- Total Customers, New Joiners, Churn Count, Churn Rate

-- Segmentation by Gender, Age Group, Location, Contract Type

-- Tenure analysis for churn prediction

-- Payment method and service usage patterns

-- Interactive slicers for demographic and service filtering

-- Customer ID

-- Gender, Age Group, Location

-- Service Subscriptions (Internet, Phone, Streaming, etc.)

-- Contract Type (Month-to-Month, One-Year, Two-Year)

-- Tenure (Duration with company)

-- Churn Flag (Yes/No)

-- 📦 Total Records: 7,000+ customers
